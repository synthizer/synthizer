 * type.
 *
 * Synthizer does initialization as a two-step process:
 * - First the constructor is called. It should not rely on being
 *   in the audio thread, and may be called from any thread.
 * - Then initInAudioThread is called, which is in the context's audio thread. initInAudioThread should try to avoid
 * allocating if at all possible.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: initInAudioThread is called async, and may be called after other calls to the object via the C API. This
 * is because blocking on the audio thread introduces a huge amount of latency and performance degradation.
