# Introduction

This is the manual for [Synthizer](https://github.com/synthizer/synthizer), a library for 3D audio and synthesis with a
focus on games and VR applications.

There are 3 ways to learn Synthizer:

- This manual acts as a conceptual overview, as well as an API and object reference.  If you have worked with audio
  libraries before, you can likely read the concepts section and hit the ground running.  In particular, Synthizer is
  much like a more limited (but faster) form of WebAudio.
- The Python bindings are no longer officially extended without community contribution, but [their
  repository](https://github.com/synthizer/synthizer-python) contains a number of examples and tutorials.
- Finally, the [official repository](https://github.com/synthizer/synthizer) contains a number of C examples.
