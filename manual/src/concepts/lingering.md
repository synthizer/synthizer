# Configuring Objects to Continue Playing Until Silent

By default, Synthizer objects become silent when their reference counts go to 0, but this isn't always what you want.
Sometimes, it is desirable to be able to continue playing audio until the object is "finished", for example for gunshots
or other one-off effects.  Synthizer calls this lingering, and offers the following API to configure it:

```
struct syz_DeleteBehaviorConfig {
    int linger;
    double linger_timeout;
};

SYZ_CAPI void syz_initDeleteBehaviorConfig(struct syz_DeleteBehaviorConfig *cfg);
SYZ_CAPI syz_ErrorCode syz_configDeleteBehavior(syz_Handle object, struct syz_DeleteBehaviorConfig *cfg);
```

To use it, call `syz_initDeleteBehaviorConfig` on an empty `syz_DeleteBehaviorConfig` struct, fill out the struct, and
call `syz_configDeleteBehavior`.  The fields have the following meaning:

- `linger`: if 0, die immediately, which is the default.  If 1, keep the object around until it "finishes".  What this
  means depends on the object and is documented in the object reference, but it generally "does what you'd expect". For
  some examples:
  - `BufferGenerator` will stop any looping and play until the end of the buffer, or die immediately if paused.
  - All sources will keep going until all their generators are no longer around.
- `linger_timeout`: if nonzero, set an upper bound on the amount of time an object may linger for.  This is useful as a
  sanity check in your application.

These functions only *configure* what happens when the last reference to an object goes away and do *not* destroy the
object or manipulate the reference count in any other way.  It is valid to call them immediately after object creation
if desired.  No Synthizer interface besides `syz_handleDecRef` will destroy an object unless otherwise explicitly
documented.

Lingering doesn't keep related objects alive.  For example a `BufferGenerator` that is lingering still goes silent if
the buffer attached to it is destroyed.

As with pausing, bindings usually make this an instance method.
