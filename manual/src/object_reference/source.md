# Source (abstract)

## Constructors

None.

## Properties

Enum | Type | Default | Range | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
SYZ_P_GAIN | double | Any double > 0 | An additional gain factor applied to this source.
SYZ_P_FILTER | biquad | any | identity | A filter which applies to all audio leaving the source, before `SYZ_P_FILTER_DIRECT` and `SYZ_P_FILTER_EFFECTS`.
SYZ_P_FILTER_DIRECT | biquad | any | identity | A filter which applies after `SYZ_P_FILTER` but not to audio traveling to effect sends.
SYZ_P_FILTER_EFFECTS | biquad | any | identity | A filter which runs after `SYZ_P_FILTER` but only applies to audio traveling through effect sends.

## Functions

### `syz_sourceAddGenerator`, `syz_sourceRemoveGenerator`

```
SYZ_CAPI syz_ErrorCode syz_sourceAddGenerator(syz_Handle source, syz_Handle generator);
SYZ_CAPI syz_ErrorCode syz_sourceRemoveGenerator(syz_Handle source, syz_Handle generator);
```

Add/remove a generator from a source. Each generator may be added once and duplicate add calls will have no effect. Each generator should only be used with one source at a time.

### `syz_pause`, `syz_play`

```
syz_ErrorCode syz_pause(syz_Handle object);
syz_ErrorCode syz_play(syz_Handle object);

```

The standard play/pause functions.  Note that all subclasses of Source will still process panners for the time being,
so this doesn't make a Source free in terms of things like HRTF and effect sends.  This case will be optimized further in future.

When a Source is paused, no generator connected to it advances even if the generator is unpaused.

## Remarks

Sources represent audio output.  They combine all generators connected to them, apply any effects if necessary, and feed the context. Subclasses of Source add panning and other features.


All sources offer filters via `SYZ_P_FILTER`, `SYZ_P_FILTER_DIRECT` and `SYZ_P_FILTER_EFFECTS`.
First, `SYZ_P_FILTER` is applied, then the audio is split into two paths: the portion heading directly to the speakers gets `SYZ_P_FILTER_DIRECT`, and the portion
heading to the effect sends gets `SYZ_P_FILTER_EFFECTS`.  This can be used to simulate occlusion and perform other per-source effect customization.
